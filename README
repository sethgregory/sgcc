SGCC - Seth Gregory C Compiler
Seth Gregory, Final Project
December 14th / Extension Feb 4th

----------------------------------

A full automated test suite can be run by simply typing:
> make test

To compile SGCC and run manually, in the directory containing the source, type:
> make

Next, to run SGCC, invoke the program on a source file as shown below:
> ./sgcc test.c
or, for full verbose/debug output:
> ./sgcc test.c -v

The compiler will save a MIPS assembly file in the same directory as, and with the same filename as the C input program, but with a ".s" file extension.

Finally, to execute in spim, type:
> spim -file test.s
